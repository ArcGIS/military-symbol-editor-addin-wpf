> Please note: if you have an issue that is not specifically related to the User Interface or the Addin form itself, but is related to how the symbol draws on the map (ex. incorrect symbol, missing labels on map, line styles) please log those issues against the symbol data itself at: https://github.com/Esri/military-features-data
